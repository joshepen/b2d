# B2D: Bookmark to .desktop File Converter
I hate using my mouse so I wanted to add my bookmarks to my application launcher. Plus I thought it would be fun to make.

## Manual Installation / Run Instructions
I don't really feel like paying the $5 to register this as an official chrome extension right now so:
- Clone repo: `git clone https://github.com/joshepen/b2b`
- Open chrome extensions page: `chrome://extensions`
- Make sure `Developer mode` is checked on in the top right corner
- Click `Load unpacked` and select the repo folder

## Usage
- Click the extension to open the popup
- Select which bookmarks you would like to convert
- Click `Download`

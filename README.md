# B2D: Bookmark to .desktop File Converter
I hate using my mouse so I wanted to add my bookmarks to my application launcher. Plus I thought it would be fun to make.

## Manual Installation / Run Instructions
I don't really feel like paying the $5 to register this as an official chrome extension right now so:
- Clone repo
- Open chrome extensions page
- Make sure developer mode is checked on in the top right corner
- Click `Load unpacked` and select the repo folder

## Usage
- Click the extension to open the popup
- Select which bookmarks you would like to convert
- Click `Download`
